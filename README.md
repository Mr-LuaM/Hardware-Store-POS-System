# Hardware-Store-POS-System

**Hardware Store POS System** is a comprehensive point-of-sale (POS) solution specifically designed for hardware stores. This system streamlines essential operations, including product management, sales processing, user management, and inventory control. Built using **Java Swing** for the frontend and integrated with a database for managing real-time transactions, this project showcases the capabilities of object-oriented programming (OOP) and the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern.

---

## Project Overview

This system was developed as the **final project for the TESDA BCRV TechVoc Inc. Programming NC2 (Java)** course. It demonstrates in-depth understanding of Java programming concepts and best practices, particularly focusing on OOP principles and design patterns such as MVC. The system provides a smooth and efficient user experience for hardware store management, handling inventory, transactions, and reporting.

## Features

- **Product Management**: Easily add, update, and manage product inventory.
- **Sales Processing**: Real-time processing of sales, including item selection, quantity adjustment, and price calculation.
- **User Management**: Secure login for administrators and cashiers, with role-based access.
- **Sales Reporting**: Generate sales reports to track daily, weekly, or monthly transactions.
- **Inventory Control**: Automatically update stock levels based on sales, ensuring accurate and efficient inventory tracking.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Java (Vanilla)
- **Frontend**: Java Swing for GUI
- **Backend**: Java with JDBC for database connectivity
- **Database**: MySQL (or any SQL-compliant database)
- **Architecture**: MVC (Model-View-Controller)

---

## Purpose

This system was developed to demonstrate and solidify our understanding of core Java programming concepts, focusing on real-world applications of OOP principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. It also emphasizes the use of **MVC architecture**, allowing a clear separation between the user interface, business logic, and data handling.

## Educational Value

The source code is available for **educational purposes**. It has been shared with classmates to help them **learn** and **understand** how to implement a full-featured Java-based POS system. By reviewing and modifying the code, classmates can strengthen their knowledge of Java, particularly with respect to working with graphical user interfaces (GUI) and databases.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**: Clone the project to your local environment.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Mr-LuaM/Hardware-Store-POS-System.git
    ```
2. **Open the project**: Use **Eclipse** or any Java-compatible IDE to open the project.
3. **Setup the Database**: Configure the MySQL database with the provided scripts in the `/db` folder.
4. **Run the System**: Compile and run the application to start managing products and sales for the hardware store.

## Project Status

This project is complete and functional, though future enhancements and updates may be made based on feedback and additional requirements. Suggestions and improvements from classmates and other contributors are welcome.

---

**Note**: This project has been created to fulfill the **TESDA NC2 final project requirements** for the **Programming Java** course at **BCRV TechVoc Inc.**
